# Mastering-Simulink-with-Key-Modeling-Task
I’m thrilled to share my Simulink modeling journey, which focuses on three key tasks:  Discrete Proportional-Integral Controller, Integrator and Signal Assessment. These tasks have significantly enhanced my understanding of system dynamics and control theory.Peregrine Falcon Dive Simulation
Discrete Proportional-Integral Controller:
Modeled a PI controller, adjusting 𝐾𝑝, 𝐾𝑖, and 𝑇𝑠 to observe their effects on the controller output.

Peregrine Falcon Dive Simulation:
Simulated the dive dynamics of a peregrine falcon, including its deceleration by opening its wings.

Integrator and Signal Assessment:
Worked on integrating signals and assessing their performance within a model.

These tasks have significantly enhanced my understanding of system dynamics and control theory.
